            <h1>My Favorite Thing</h1>
                <p>I am very passionate about... nothing. I guess that's a thing, not necessarily a passion, but I would have to leave this plain text empty if that were the case.</p>
            <h2>My Favorite Movie</h2>
                <p>It's difficult to pick just one movie that I would consider my favorite, so I will give you my top three, in no particular order/ranking. Coraline, Silver Linings:Playbook, and Joker</p>
